# Android Vinesauce ROM Corruptor

Vinesauce ROM Corruptor is a tools app developed by Viveret. It was based on the original Windows Application by Rikerz

The APK has been available _since March 2015_. It has been removed from the Google Play store since. The last update of the app was on _April 14, 2016_ and was designed to run on Android version _4.0._

_We do not recommend using this app as it will most likely not give out results that provide much entertainment. After it was removed from the Google Play store, various cloned versions were published on Google Play over the years, including fake clones that injected Ads._

Viveret eventually renamed the application to Android File Scrambler. It doesn't appear to be available on Google Play anymore.
