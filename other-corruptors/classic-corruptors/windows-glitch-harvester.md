<table data-header-hidden><thead><tr><th valign="top"></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top"><p>WARNING:</p><p>Windows Glitch Harvester is an old corruptor. If you are looking to just corrupt Windows files and programs, check out RTCV + FileStub/ProcessStub instead. This has been tested on Win9x and WinXP. You may need to disable the Multithreading option on win9x</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

### How to use

WGH Legacy works similarly to RTC's Glitch Harvester but everything is crammed into a single window.

You have access to a Stash History and Stockpile Manager just like in RTC but be weary that the stockpile format is flaky in this one.

Keep in mind that this is not real-time, just like with FileStub. If you are getting errors, make sure your corrupted file is not already in use.

DO NOT corrupt things that you don't have backups of. The Backup system in WGH is much inferior to the one in FileStub.

### Application support

We can only offer support if you use this application on a legacy system such as Win9x, Win2000 or WinXP. If you use Windows 7 and newer, use FileStub instead.
