# What makes a good corruption?

This article is based on research a project by JezzDawga. The art or creating videogame corruptions is something that is normally influenced by one's skills and tastes. Because of that fact, what we consider a good corruption is completely subjective and greatly varies with every individual.

_Simply consider the information on this page as a representation of the community's general taste in corrupted videogames._\

## Positives

This chapter covers content that helps make a Corruption stand out and be interesting.

{% hint style="info" %}
We suggest getting as many different types of Positives as possible (and as aesthetically appropriate), but also to avoid overusing the same Positives consecutively.
{% endhint %}

_In short, have variety._

The following content has been determined to make the Funny, with some of the best examples shown on Vinesauce for each:

## Negatives

If your corruption contains even one of these items, you need to fight an uphill battle for it to be considered good quality.

It is therefore generally advised to exclude all items listed here from any of your submissions, if you’re looking to make high quality works.

{% hint style="info" %}
Only the most kick-ass, revolutionary corruptions made with pure mastery of the craft, can contain one or more negatives and still be considered good.
