# Safety and Ethics of Corruptions

While corrupting is fun it is important to remember that at core corruption is a form of destructive data manipulation. Thus it is **imperative** to remember to be safe and ethical in corrupting.

## Never corrupt data that you are not prepared to permanently lose.

When corrupting with any software (VSRC, SSRC, VineCorrupt, etc.) or Vanguard (FileStub) that directly targets raw files you should **assume that the file you are corrupting will be lost**. Never put full stake into FileStub's vault, **always make a manual back up of the data you intend to corrupt.**&#x20;

## Prepare before corrupting critical software.

When using any software (Cheat Engine) or Vanguard (ProcessStub) that targets running processes make sure that it is safe to corrupt the process you intend to. **Randomly corrupting Windows processes is a very dumb game to play**, especially on your main device. If you don't know what you're doing **make a VM, or prepare a burner PC.** This is less important when targeting games, but **it never hurts to be safe**.

## Never corrupt uncontrolled local environments

Do not ever run RTCV on a device where you are not the administrator, or do not have permission from the administrator.

Do not run RTCV on work, school, or public devices.&#x20;

if the answer to the question: "_Do I own this device?_" Is no, then you should not be corrupting it.

## Never corrupt uncontrolled online environments&#x20;

**Never corrupt any online game that connects to a larger server.** \
This means no Roblox, no Fortnite, no Temtem, no Overwatch, etc. \
**Corrupting these games is worse then hacking them.** It's not just you that gets in trouble, **you risk getting the whole of the corruption community in trouble.**&#x20;

**You risk the livelihood of everyone in this community. You risk destroying and obliterating the whole corruptions scene by giving it bad rep.**&#x20;

Much like hacking or cheating in a game, corrupting online games like can and will **harm the playing experience of other players.**

**You may not be able to observe the damage done on the other side.**\
**You can and will get banned from these games.**

Doing this **leads to RTCV being labelled as a tool for online disruption,** and leads to things such as **antivirus software marking RTCV as unsafe.** **This also ruins peoples first time impressions of RTCV.**\
\
**Demonstration of any uncontrolled online corrupting in the various Corruptions communities will get you banned as this is generally deemed as a grave offense.**

## Performing safe online corrupting

Client/Server games where you can host your own server should be safe to corrupt. Make sure you disable any anti-cheat option while creating your own private server (such as VAC).

**The only safe online games to corrupt are ones which you control the whole environment and where everyone involved is aware.** As long as all server members know, games such as Counter-Strike, Minecraft and Terraria should be fine to corrupt.\
Similarly, games that use a peer-to-peer system such as Doom should also be safe to corrupt as long as all users are aware.

**The bottom line is: as long as you control the whole online environment of the game, and all users have consented to the experience it is okay to corrupt the game.**

As a final note, we the developers of RTCV ask you to keep videos of online corruptions to a minimum (or avoid them) and to explain in the video or in it's accompanying description what you have done to make sure that you are corrupting in a controlled environment. \
Thank you.
