チートバグ : The Japanese scene

{% embed url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnVkVUppso4" %}

The Japanese Cheatbug scene is a fascinating subculture within the video game corruption community, where enthusiasts manipulate games to create glitch-filled videos. This article explores the origins, terminology, methods, and cross-cultural collaborations that make this scene unique.

["What is a cheatbug?" ](https://dic.nicovideo.jp/a/%E3%83%81%E3%83%BC%E3%83%88%E3%83%90%E3%82%B0%E5%8B%95%E7%94%BB)

Terminology and Origins:

* "cheatbug" : Japanese term for "Corruptions". Comes from the fact that corruptions in the cheatbug community are mainly created by modifying software using cheats (such as the Game Genie cheats)
* "Nishikigao" : Used when talking about corrupted faces created through cheats. Originated from a Famicom Captain Tsubasa game where a corruption made a character retain a funny face while saying "Nishikigaoka Koukou"
* "Kireboshi" : Originated from a FC Dragon Quest IV game cheat-bug video, where text saying "ばしゃと　ききゅうが　そとで　まっております" (A carriage and a hot-air balloon wait outside) and "あ　ながれぼし！" (Oh, a shooting star!) merged, resulting in "ばしゃと　きれぼし！" (A carriage and kireboshi). "Kireboshi" didn't have a meaning, but since this was from an early cheat-bug, it became a tradition to meme it. It is now used as a community greeting.
* "Generation center" : A now-defunct website for generating cheat codes.
* "Seisei" (生成) : Originated from a Captain Tsubasa where the text turned into "sei sei sei". Means "Generating a coruption.

Methods and Tools:

* Standard Debuggers used: Code searching on PS2 with PCSX2, Cheat Engine and no$ emulator series.
* ["cep補助ツール" : Tool for generating cheats for PSX ](http://drhell.web.fc2.com/labo/index.html)
* ["mecc": Soft Vector search for windows](https://www.vector.co.jp/soft/winnt/hardware/se476625.html)&#x20;
* "CCCFR": Tool for generating cheat codes and exploring memory edits for DS.
* [The lost corruption tool "urajijo" ](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/279664862836031488/835743912232484915/urajijo.zip)

Interesting Facts:

* The cheatbug Discord community has about 200 members, indicating an active and engaged group of enthusiasts interested in video game corruptions.

* Like in the western corruptions community, the Japanese cheatbug scene also faces challenges in maintaining interest when corrupting the same games repeatedly.
* The cheatbug community utilizes various software and tools based on the hardware and games they are working with. For PlayStation 2 corruptions, the PCSX2 emulator with debugger functionality is employed, while older games might be debugged using the "no$" series of debugging emulators.
* Cheatbug videos often require extensive research and experimentation to achieve the desired glitched effects. The creators carefully manipulate graphics, memory, and code to produce glitch-filled content that captivates viewers.
* Certain terms like "Nishikigao" and "Kireboshi" originated from specific cheat-bug videos and have become widely adopted within the community, showcasing how memes and unique language have integrated into cheatbug culture. They are essentially the japanese equivalent of "SPEEN", "One note orchestra" and "Mario turns pink and dies"
* Besides memory-based corruptions, some cheatbug enthusiasts explore hardware-level modifications, like physically modifying consoles to achieve specific glitch effects, leading to unique and innovative approaches to video game corruptions.

The Japanese Cheatbug scene thrives on creativity, collaboration, and fascination with glitched video game content. Enthusiasts from different backgrounds come together, pushing the boundaries of video game corruptions. As this subculture evolves, it leaves an indelible mark on the gaming world, captivating fans and fostering a shared passion for the wonders of cheatbug creations.
