#### How to use the Sequence Loader Plugin

1. Open the Sequence Loader Plugin tool in the Advanced tools section (Bottom right).
2. There are two ways to load a file:

* Click the "Load Sequenced song from File" button and select the file you want to load.
* Drag and drop the file into the plugin window in the rectangle area on the top-right

3. The plugin will create a save state so you can replay the song over and over again and corrupt it.
4. NSF files can contain an entire soundtrack, so you can use the "next song" button to load a new song into a GH save state.
5. SPC files are dumps of the contents of the SPC700 chips. They can be used to corrupt the music over and over again.

#### Things to keep in mind

* NSF files are not perfect replicas of the music that was playing in the game. Some games, such as Mario 3, do not replay perfectly.
* SPC files relies on an open source program called SPC loader that gets wrapped into a ROM before it can be used with the Sequence Loader Plugin. This supports most games but doesnâ€™t have perfect compatibility (ex: very very long songs)
* It can take time to get good results with the Sequence Loader Plugin. Don't expect to get immediate results.
