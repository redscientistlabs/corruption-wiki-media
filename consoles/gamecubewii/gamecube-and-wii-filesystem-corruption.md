### Usage

These are lists that contain many variations of values used by program code. Corrupting using these value lists dramatically increases the chances of hitting game code.

For general purposes, a recommended usage is the Giga list as Limiter and the NOP list as a Value. Play around with the Value lists. You can also swap the Limiter and Value lists for different results.
