* Open FileStub and drag your `.jar` file into the box labeled "Quick Load drag and drop zone."
* In RTC's main window, click "Custom Layouts" on the left and select "Load Java Corruptor."
* Select your engine settings, then click the corrupt button under Blast Tools. Do not click the corrupt button on the far left.
* There will be a new `.jar` file with a long name in the version folder. In Prism launcher right-click your instance and click edit. Go to the version tab and click "Replace Minecraft.jar." Go to the same path as in step 6 and add the new corrupted `.jar` file.
* Launch your corrupted Minecraft instance from the launcher. Your game will be corrupted. Whenever you make a corruption, a new `.jar` file will be created, and you will have to replace the Minecraft.jar each time.
