# Corrupting the NES

## Introduction

The Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) is an 8-bit third-generation home video game console produced, released, and marketed by Nintendo.

Recommended setup: Nightmare engine, Hellgenie, Freeze, Pipe

## Recommended Settings

The NES is a system with very little memory. It runs its programs directly from the ROM. The default settings in RTC are adequate for corrupting the system. If you add the System Bus or PRG ROM to the selected domains, it will unlock many more effects but makes rewind unusable for uncorrupting. You can get more results using 6502 Instruction Lists.

## Expected results

Due to its age, the NES will very often spit a lot of visual corruption. Games will freeze/crash when corrupted with a lot of intensity. However, the Bizhawk Nes cores are very stable and the NES very rarely cause Bizhawk itself to crash.
