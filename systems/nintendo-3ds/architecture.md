# Architecture

### Architecture:

A custom SoC developed by Nintendo. It includes four ARM CPUs of three types: two ARM11 MPCores, an ARM946E-S, and an ARM7TDMI. Fun fact, the latter two were used in the Nintendo DS and GameBoy Advance respectively. It also included a PICA200 GPU, which helped render the 3d graphics.
