## Memory Domains

### Bizhawk

* FCRam(128MB): The main memory (RAM) component where most loaded data is stored. Uses ARMv6K architecture.
* VRAM(6MB): Stores data for the GPU to produce screen visuals. Uses PICA200 shader architecture.
* DSP RAM(512KB): Stores binary audio files used to recognize/produce sounds. Unknown architecture (probably raw sound data).
* N3DS Extra RAM(128MB): Extended FCRam included with the New 3DS (only used in later titles). Uses ARMv6K architecture.
* System Bus: Moves data between the different processors/components on the SoC. Uses a mixed architecture.

### Citra

* FCRam(128MB): The main memory (RAM) component where most loaded data is stored. Uses ARMv6K architecture.
