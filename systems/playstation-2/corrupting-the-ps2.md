# Corrupting the PS2

### Introduction

The PlayStation 2 (officially branded as PS2) is a home video game console developed and marketed by Sony Computer Entertainment. The console builds on its home entertainment value by doubling as a DVD player and accommodating most of the original PlayStation's vast library of games.&#x20;

At the moment, the best way to corrupt PS2 is with RTC, through PCSX2-Vanguard.&#x20;

## Recommended Settings

The PS2 corrupts very similarly to the Gamecube and Wii. PCSX2 is less stable than Dolphin but it is still sort of comparable. EERAM being the only exposed domain, there's no other domain to corrupt. You can get more results using MIPS Instruction Lists.
