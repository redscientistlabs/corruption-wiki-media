N64 corruption tends to be more sophisticated and difficult than corruptions on it's 2D predecessors, but the results can be extremely rewarding. By moving to 3D corruption, you're literally and figuratively adding a new dimension to the possibilities of what you can achieve with a corruptor. N64 corruptions were one of the first 3D corruptions attempted, and they remain a staple in the corruption scene today. Detailed below are several methods of corrupting N64, including with the Vinesauce ROM Corruptor and the Real-Time Corruptor.
