# N64 Architecture

The Nintendo 64 is a home console that was released by Nintendo in 1996. It has a 64-bit NEC VR4300 CPU running at 93.75 MHz, a 64-bit Reality Coprocessor running at 62.5 MHz with 100 MFLOPS. The GPU is actually 2 processors in one, the Reality Display Processor and the Reality Signal Processor can render 3D graphics with texture mapping, lighting and anti-aliasing, and 4 MB of RDRAM (expandable to 8 MB with the Expansion Pak). It uses cartridges as its primary storage format, which have faster loading times but lower capacity than CDs.
