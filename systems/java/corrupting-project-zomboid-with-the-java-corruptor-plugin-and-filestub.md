1. Install FileStub from the RTC Launcher.
2. Open the package downloader from the RTC Launcher.
3. Click PLUGINS, then scroll down and click on the Java Corruptor package. The package downloader might crash while downloading it. If that happens, just try again.
4. Open your Project Zomboid installation's folder, and enter the `zombie` folder.
5. Select everything in that folder and add it all into a `.zip` file.
6. Rename that `.zip` file to a `.jar`.
7. Open FileStub and drag your `.jar` file into the box labeled "Quick Load drag and drop zone."
8. In RTC's main window, click "Custom Layouts" on the left and select "Load Java Corruptor."
9. In the top right, underneath Corruption Engine, select Arithmetic Engine from the dropdown.
10. In the two boxes on the right with math operations, select addition, subtraction, and multiplication in both.
11. Click the corrupt button under Blast Tools. Do not click the corrupt button on the far left.
12. There will be a new `.jar` file with a long name in the `zombie` folder. Extract its contents into the folder, replacing everything.
13. Start Project Zomboid. It will be corrupted. Whenever you make a corruption, a new `.jar` file will be created, and you will have to extract that file as well.
14. Feel free to experiment with corrupting the other `.jar` files and folders with `.class` files as well. Ones with names related to LWJGL, OpenGL, and math might create interesting corruptions.
