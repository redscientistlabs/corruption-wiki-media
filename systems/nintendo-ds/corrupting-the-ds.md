### Introduction

Nintendo DS was the first handheld by Nintendo to achieve true 3D, and similarly Nintendo DS was the starting point for corruption of 3D games. It was from experimentation with corruption of this console that N64 corruption and everything after came to be.&#x20;

At the moment, the best way to corrupt Nintendo DS is with RTC and MelonDS-Vanguiard.
